								<b>What are deepfakes - and how can you spot them?</b> (EP 1)
<br><br>
Deepfakes are a tool to make videos that resemble legitimate events but are edited,
similar to photoshop. The primary use-case so far has been in pornography, but they can
also be used to make videos of anyone - including influential figures like politicians and
celebrities - where they can be portrayed saying damaging things. The visual and audio
components of these videos can be faked using a form of artificial intelligence called
deep learning. However, this technology isn’t limited to videos, photos and audio can
also be faked.

<b>Push to rein in social media sweeps the states</b> (EP 2)
<br><br>
This article focuses on how speech on social media may potentially be regulated.
Democratic lawmakers are mostly focused on misinformation and hate speech, while
Republican lawmakers hope to prevent people from being censored. Either side of the
argument threatens to destroy the entire business model of these massive tech companies,
and will likely face major pushback from them.

<b>Deepfakes: A Digital Transformation Leads to Misinformation</b> (EP 3)
<br><br>
This paper focuses on both deepfakes and the presence of grey media. The paper focuses
on video deepfakes present in media. Deepfakes are becoming easier to develop, to the
point where an unskilled individual can distribute misinformation without much effort or
technological knowledge. In addition, deepfakes are becoming harder to detect and
distinguish from real speech. Individuals who already spread misinformation use
deepfakes as an advanced means of doing so.

<b>Man behind viral Tom Cruise deepfake videos calls the technology ‘morally neutral’</b> (EP 1)
<br><br>
This article highlights the ethical issues presented with making deepfake videos
containing celebrities. Miles Fisher used deepfake to create videos that make him look
like the actor Tom Cruise and posted them on TikTok where they went viral. The article
poses the question as to what the intellectual property rights were for the videos, would it
belong to Tom Cruise, or to the video’s maker. In addition, concerns are raised on the
negative potential use cases of the deepfake technology.

<b>The Humiliation of Katie Hill Offers a Warning</b> (EP 1, EP 4)
<br><br>
This article gives background information and explores the ending of Representative
Katie Hill’s career. The article explains how explicit photographs of Katie Hill were
released to the public by the oppositional party in an attempt to undermine her position in
the House of Representatives. The move is considered a form of revenge porn, or when
nonconsensual nudity is released into the public causing severe anxiety, depression, and
in some cases loss of jobs.

<b>Medical Deepfakes Are the Real Deal</b> (EP 1)
<br><br>
This article gives insight into the use of deepfakes in the medical industry. More and
more companies developing medical imaging artificial intelligence are being cleared by
the FDA for use in the industry. Deepfake algorithms can be used in many use case
scenarios within the industry. For example, they can be used to extend x-ray scans to
show parts of the body outside the field of view of the scan, allowing doctors and patients
to get the full region required to make a diagnosis.

<b>Anticipating and addressing the ethical implications of deepfakes in the context of
elections</b> (EP 2, EP 3)
<br><br>
This peer reviewed article highlights the ethical implications of deepfakes, specifically
considering its potential impact on elections. Deepfakes can distort the information voters
use to make decisions, which can undermine the integrity of the election. The paper
outlines possible scenarios where deepfakes could be used in elections: to harm
viewers/listeners, harm subjects and harm social institutions. Some of the specific use
cases include deception, intimidation, misattribution, and undermining trust.
