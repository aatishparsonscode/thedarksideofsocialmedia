									<h2>Deepfakes</h2>
									<p>Deepfakes are a tool to make videos that resemble legitimate events but are actually edited - similar to photoshop. The primary use-case so far has been in pornography, but they can also be used to make videos of anyone - including influential figures like politicians and celebrities - where they can be portrayed saying damaging things. The visual and audio components of these videos can be faked using a form of artificial intelligence called deep learning.</p>

									<h2>Content Moderation</h2>
									<p>Speech on social media may potentially be regulated. Primarily in speech. Democratic lawmakers are mostly focused on misinformation and hate speech, while Republican lawmakers hope to prevent people from being censored. Either side of the argument threatens to destroy the entire business model of these massive tech companies, and will likely face major pushback from them.</p>

									<h2>Targeted Information</h2>
									<p>TikTok gathers tons of information about each user, including location, IP address, search history, messages, and what content you view. It also guesses other information like your gender and age. Finally, it even collects biometric information like your face and voice. This information is all extremely valuable to advertisers, and potentially the Chinese government.</p>

									<h2>Mental Health</h2>
									<p>There have been numerous studies which indicate that social media has a negative impact on the mental health of individuals. Some of the effects include overstimulation, which is decreasing our attention span, stressing us out, and increasing feelings of loneliness, isolation, and depression.</p>

							<h2>About</h2>
							<h3>Vikram & Aatish - UW students</h3>
							<p>Available on all major social media platforms!</p>
							<p>We decided to form this podcast out of a desire to help our community. All of us are collectively affected and interact with social media in some way. We felt bringing <b>awareness</b> to some of the negatives of social media will help listeners create a whole picture of social media. As the advent of social media occurred in the last few decades, there is little research to establish the <b>long term effects</b> of social media. However, studies have shown there are negative effects of social media, specifically those related to <b>fraud, mental health, and misinformation</b>. However, as technology is constantly evolving the positives and negatives of social media are continuously renewed. As research can sometimes take years, and is constantly being produced, it can be hard for the general public to keep up with the <b>newfound detriments</b> of social media.</p>
							<p><b>Our purpose</b> is to educate and bring light to the newest technological advancements that relate to social media. Individuals 18-29 are statistically those who use social media more. As a result, we cater our podcast episodes to that demographic. We feel that those individuals have the most to benefit from the information we provide. We take our jobs seriously, and only rely on <b>verifiable sources</b> such as the most up to date academic research and reputable second and first hand sources. </p>
							<p><b>How you can help:</b> We require a soundproof room to record audio along with high fidelity microphones.</p>
